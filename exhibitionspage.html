                  Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                  'The Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see
                  and know about the universe around us. We'll locate the
                  various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
                  a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel
                  by.

                  <p>
                    For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled
                    with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and
                    how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of
                    evolution we have had a framework for exploring and
                    understanding our place in this world.

                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
                    species we know today have evolved our time. You can also
                    take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't
                    survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a
                    number of dinosaurs too.

                    From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs
                    in biology are offering us unique insights into the great
                    wonders of the tiny world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and
                    their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of
                    our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we
                    explore the history of medicine and take a look at some
                    major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin
                    and the first heart transplant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only
                    from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
                    Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                  The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
                  intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
                  applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future
                  is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the
                  Robot.

                  As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on
                  the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists
                  explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans
                  but for the whole planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
                  currently face including global warming, extinction of
                  species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways
                  we can all contribute to a brighter future.
