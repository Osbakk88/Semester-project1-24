## Description

The site provides information about exhibitions, events, visiting hours, and contribution opportunities. Designed to be accessible and engaging for all visitors.

This project demonstrates:

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Modern CSS design with Grid and Flexbox
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, modular code organization

## Key Improvements

A lot of improvements were done to this page as I originally was not satisfied with my work at all. I was not proud of my work and this project really needed some updates.

### Accessibility

- Fixed HTML validation errors (invalid nesting, proper semantic structure)
- Added skip navigation and ARIA labels for screen readers
- Implemented keyboard navigation with focus indicators
- Added meta descriptions for SEO
- Proper form labels and associations

### Design & Layout

- Modern card-based design with shadows and rounded corners
- Dark theme (#1a1a1a) with light content cards for contrast
- Responsive grid layouts that adapt to mobile devices
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Consistent 8rem margins with mobile breakpoints at 768px

### Page Updates

- **Exhibitions**: Grid layout with image overlays and modern cards
- **News**: Connected image-text cards with unified styling
- **Contact**: Improved form design with better focus states
- **All pages**: Better typography, spacing, and mobile responsiveness

## Built With

- **HTML** - For the page structure and content
- **CSS** - For styling (used Flexbox and Grid to make it responsive)
- **Google Fonts** - For the typography (Klee One, Quattrocento Sans, Fira Sans, Halant)
- **Git & GitHub** - To save my work and keep track of changes
